Built for those who use a large number of kneeboard pages, this tool allows you to pick which kneeboard categories you will need, and install those in your DCS's Kneeboard folder for you.

This can greatly cut down the number of kneeboards you will need to flick through.

It can be used as a "launcher" for DCS, as well as just a simple tool to save your kneeboard selection whenever.

## Quick Start

Windows might warn you about untrusted software. Click _Details_ then _Run Anyway_ if that is the case.

After launching the program, select your DCS instance, a map and an aircraft.

Let's add a new KB category for this selected map by right-clicking the background of _Map Kneeboards_.

Once the category is created, right click it to open the folder.

You can put the actual kneeboard page images for this category in there now.

To add a new category to the selected aircraft, right-click the _Airframe Kneeboards_ list instead.

_Common Kneeboards_ are categories that can be used across multiple maps and multiple airframes.

I tend to forget changing my callsign before missions, so I've also added the possibility to set your callsign right here.

### Example Structure

Once done, your folders should look something like this.

## Notes

Due to the sheer number of kneeboards that come with Caucasus, I recommend disabling the built-in list by renaming your `DCS World\Mods\terrains\Caucasus\Kneeboard` folder to something like `Kneeboard-old`

You can use categorized pages for Caucasus instead - simply unzip [this package](https://github.com/galister/dcs-kbm/raw/caucasus-pack/Caucasus.zip) into your `Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\KneeboardManager\Maps` folder.
